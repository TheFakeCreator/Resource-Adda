# PR Description Generator

## When to Use

- User asks for a PR title and description
- User provides commit titles/messages and wants a PR writeup
- User says "PR", "pull request", "generate PR", "PR description"
- Before creating a pull request on GitHub

## Procedure

### Step 1: Gather Commit Information

The user will provide commit titles and descriptions. If not provided, ask the user for them, or retrieve them from git:

```bash
# Get commits on current branch that are not on dev
git log --oneline upstream/dev..HEAD

# Get commits with full messages
git log --pretty=format:"%h %s%n%b%n---" upstream/dev..HEAD
```

### Step 2: Analyze All Commits

Group the commits by their type and scope to understand the overall PR:

1. **Identify the primary theme** — What is the main purpose of this set of commits?
2. **List all change categories** — `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `chore`, etc.
3. **Identify affected scopes** — `(api)`, `(frontend)`, `(auth)`, etc.
4. **Find related issues** — Look for `Closes #N` or `#N` references

### Step 3: Generate PR Title

#### Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <concise summary of all changes>
```

#### Rules

- If all commits are the same type → use that type
- If mixed types with one dominant → use the dominant type
- If truly mixed → use the most impactful type (usually `feat` > `fix` > `refactor` > `chore` > `docs`)
- Keep under 72 characters
- Imperative mood, lowercase, no period
- The title should capture the **overall goal**, not list individual commits

#### Examples

| Commits                                                                                              | PR Title                                       |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `feat(api): add vendor endpoint` + `test(api): add vendor tests` + `docs: update api reference`      | `feat(api): add vendor rating system`          |
| `fix(auth): handle expired tokens` + `fix(auth): validate refresh token`                             | `fix(auth): improve token expiration handling` |
| `docs: update setup guide` + `docs: add api reference` + `chore: update readme`                      | `docs: consolidate developer documentation`    |
| `feat(ci): add preview deployments` + `chore(config): add dynamic api url` + `docs: update ci guide` | `feat(ci): add automated preview deployments`  |

### Step 4: Generate PR Description

Use the **exact template format** from `.github/pull_request_template.md`:

```markdown
## 📝 Description

<Write a clear, concise description of what this PR accomplishes.
Summarize the commits into a coherent narrative. Explain WHY these
changes were made, not just WHAT changed.>

## Important Notes

> [!CAUTION]
> **Do NOT inject meta-commentary, reminders, or callouts into the generated PR description.** The output must contain only the template sections — nothing extra like "This PR targets dev" or similar notes. Keep the output clean and copy-pasteable.

> [!NOTE]
> Internal awareness: PRs must always target the `dev` branch, never `main`. Only mention this if the user explicitly asks which branch to target — never embed it in the generated output.

> [!TIP]
> If the user provides commit titles without descriptions, generate the PR description by inferring the purpose from the commit titles and any available diff context.
